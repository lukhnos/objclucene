 @brief The payloads package provides Query mechanisms for finding and using payloads.
 <p>
    The following Query implementations are provided:   
 <ol>
     <li>
       <code>PayloadScoreQuery</code> --
         Boost a document's score from a SpanQuery based on the values of the payloads located at the matching terms    
 </li>
     <li><code>PayloadTermQuery</code> -- Boost a term's score based on the value of the payload located at that term.</li>
     <li><code>PayloadNearQuery</code> -- A <code>SpanNearQuery</code> that factors in the value of the payloads located 
         at each of the positions where the spans occur.</li>
    </ol>
