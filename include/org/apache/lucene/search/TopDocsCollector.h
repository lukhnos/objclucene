 @brief A base class for all collectors that return a <code>TopDocs</code> output.
 This
 collector allows easy extension by providing a single constructor which
 accepts a <code>PriorityQueue</code> as well as protected members for that
 priority queue and a counter of the number of total hits.<br>
 Extending classes can override any of the methods to provide their own
 implementation, as well as avoid the use of the priority queue entirely by
 passing null to <code>TopDocsCollector(PriorityQueue)</code>. In that case
 however, you might want to consider overriding all methods, in order to avoid
 a NullPointerException.
