 @brief Expert: comparator that gets instantiated on each leaf
 from a top-level <code>FieldComparator</code> instance.
 <p>A leaf comparator must define these functions:</p>
 <ul>
 <li> <code>setBottom</code> This method is called by
 <code>FieldValueHitQueue</code> to notify the
 FieldComparator of the current weakest ("bottom")
 slot.  Note that this slot may not hold the weakest
 value according to your comparator, in cases where
 your comparator is not the primary one (ie, is only
 used to break ties from the comparators before it).
 <li> <code>compareBottom</code> Compare a new hit (docID)
 against the "weakest" (bottom) entry in the queue.
 <li> <code>compareBottom</code> Compare a new hit (docID)
 against the "weakest" (bottom) entry in the queue.
 <li> <code>compareTop</code> Compare a new hit (docID)
 against the top value previously set by a call to
 <code>FieldComparator.setTopValue</code>.
 <li> <code>copy</code> Installs a new hit into the
 priority queue.  The <code>FieldValueHitQueue</code>
 calls this method when a new hit is competitive.
 </ul>
