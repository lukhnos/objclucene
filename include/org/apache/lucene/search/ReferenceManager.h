 Closes this ReferenceManager to prevent future <code>acquiring</code>.
 A
 reference manager should be closed if the reference to the managed resource
 should be disposed or the application using the <code>ReferenceManager</code>
 is shutting down. The managed resource might not be released immediately,
 if the <code>ReferenceManager</code> user is holding on to a previously
 <code>acquired</code> reference. The resource will be released once
 when the last reference is <code>released</code>. Those
 references can still be used as if the manager was still active.
 </p>
 <p>
 Applications should not <code>acquire</code> new references from this
 manager once this method has been called. <code>Acquiring</code> a
 resource on a closed <code>ReferenceManager</code> will throw an
 <code>AlreadyClosedException</code>.

 Only the first thread will attempt the refresh; subsequent threads will see
 that another thread is already handling refresh and will return
 immediately. Note that this means if another thread is already refreshing
 then subsequent threads will return right away without waiting for the
 refresh to complete.
