/*!
 @brief Similarity defines the components of Lucene scoring.
 <p>
 Expert: Scoring API.
 <p>
 This is a low-level API, you should only extend this API if you want to implement 
 an information retrieval <i>model</i>.  If you are instead looking for a convenient way 
 to alter Lucene's scoring, consider extending a higher-level implementation
 such as <code>TFIDFSimilarity</code>, which implements the vector space model with this API, or 
 just tweaking the default implementation: <code>DefaultSimilarity</code>.
 <p>
 Similarity determines how Lucene weights terms, and Lucene interacts with
 this class at both <a href="#indextime">index-time</a> and 
 <a href="#querytime">query-time</a>.
 <p>
 <a name="indextime">Indexing Time</a>
 At indexing time, the indexer calls <code>computeNorm(FieldInvertState)</code>, allowing
 the Similarity implementation to set a per-document value for the field that will 
 be later accessible via <code>org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReader.getNormValues(String)</code>.  Lucene makes no assumption
 about what is in this norm, but it is most useful for encoding length normalization 
 information.
 <p>
 Implementations should carefully consider how the normalization is encoded: while
 Lucene's classical <code>TFIDFSimilarity</code> encodes a combination of index-time boost
 and length normalization information with <code>SmallFloat</code> into a single byte, this 
 might not be suitable for all purposes.
 <p>
 Many formulas require the use of average document length, which can be computed via a 
 combination of <code>CollectionStatistics.sumTotalTermFreq()</code> and 
 <code>CollectionStatistics.maxDoc()</code> or <code>CollectionStatistics.docCount()</code>, 
 depending upon whether the average should reflect field sparsity.
 <p>
 Additional scoring factors can be stored in named
 <code>NumericDocValuesField</code>s and accessed
 at query-time with <code>org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReader.getNumericDocValues(String)</code>.
 <p>
 Finally, using index-time boosts (either via folding into the normalization byte or
 via DocValues), is an inefficient way to boost the scores of different fields if the
 boost will be the same for every document, instead the Similarity can simply take a constant
 boost parameter <i>C</i>, and <code>PerFieldSimilarityWrapper</code> can return different 
 instances with different boosts depending upon field name.
 <p>
 <a name="querytime">Query time</a>
 At query-time, Queries interact with the Similarity via these steps:
 <ol>
 <li>The <code>computeWeight(float,CollectionStatistics,TermStatistics...)</code> method is called a single time,
 allowing the implementation to compute any statistics (such as IDF, average document length, etc)
 across <i>the entire collection</i>. The <code>TermStatistics</code> and <code>CollectionStatistics</code> passed in 
 already contain all of the raw statistics involved, so a Similarity can freely use any combination
 of statistics without causing any additional I/O. Lucene makes no assumption about what is 
 stored in the returned <code>Similarity.SimWeight</code> object.
 <li>The query normalization process occurs a single time: <code>Similarity.SimWeight.getValueForNormalization()</code>
 is called for each query leaf node, <code>Similarity.queryNorm(float)</code> is called for the top-level
 query, and finally <code>Similarity.SimWeight.normalize(float,float)</code> passes down the normalization value
 and any top-level boosts (e.g. from enclosing <code>BooleanQuery</code>s).
 <li>For each segment in the index, the Query creates a <code>simScorer(SimWeight,org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReaderContext)</code>
 The score() method is called for each matching document.
 </ol>
 <p>
 <a name="explaintime">Explanations</a>
 When <code>IndexSearcher.explain(org.apache.lucene.search.Query,int)</code> is called, queries consult the Similarity's DocScorer for an 
 explanation of how it computed its score. The query passes in a the document id and an explanation of how the frequency
 was computed.
