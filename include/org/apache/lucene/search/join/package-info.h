 @brief Support for index-time and query-time joins.
 <h2>Index-time joins</h2>
 <p>The index-time joining support joins while searching, where joined
 documents are indexed as a single document block using
 <code>IndexWriter.addDocuments()</code>.  
 This is useful for any normalized content (XML documents or database tables).  In database terms, all rows for all
 joined tables matching a single row of the primary table must be
 indexed as a single document block, with the parent document
 being last in the group.</p>
 <p>When you index in this way, the documents in your index are divided
 into parent documents (the last document of each block) and child
 documents (all others).  You provide a <code>org.apache.lucene.search.Filter</code> that identifies the
 parent documents, as Lucene does not currently record any information
 about doc blocks.</p>
 <p>At search time, use <code>org.apache.lucene.search.join.ToParentBlockJoinQuery</code>
  to remap/join
 matches from any child <code>org.apache.lucene.search.Query</code> (ie, a
 query that matches only child documents) up to the parent document
 space.  The
 resulting query can then be used as a clause in any query that
 matches parent.</p>
 <p>If you only care about the parent documents matching the query, you
 can use any collector to collect the parent hits, but if you'd also
 like to see which child documents match for each parent document,
 use the <code>org.apache.lucene.search.join.ToParentBlockJoinCollector</code> to collect the hits. Once the
 search is done, you retrieve a <code>org.apache.lucene.search.grouping.TopGroups</code>
  instance from the
 <code>ToParentBlockJoinCollector.getTopGroups()</code> method.</p>
 <p>To map/join in the opposite direction, use <code>org.apache.lucene.search.join.ToChildBlockJoinQuery</code>
 .  This wraps
 any query matching parent documents, creating the joined query
 matching only child documents.
 <h2>Query-time joins</h2>
 <p>
 The query time joining is index term based and implemented as two pass search. The first pass collects all the terms from a fromField
 that match the fromQuery. The second pass returns all documents that have matching terms in a toField to the terms
 collected in the first pass.
 </p>
 <p>Query time joining has the following input:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><code>fromField</code>: The from field to join from.
 <li><code>fromQuery</code>:  The query executed to collect the from terms. This is usually the user specified query.
 <li><code>multipleValuesPerDocument</code>:  Whether the fromField contains more than one value per document
 <li><code>scoreMode</code>:  Defines how scores are translated to the other join side. If you don't care about scoring
 use <code>org.apache.lucene.search.join.ScoreMode.None</code> mode. This will disable scoring and is therefore more
 efficient (requires less memory and is faster).
 <li><code>toField</code>: The to field to join to
 </ul>
 <p>
 Basically the query-time joining is accessible from one static method. The user of this method supplies the method
 with the described input and a <code>IndexSearcher</code> where the from terms need to be collected from. The returned
 query can be executed with the same <code>IndexSearcher</code>, but also with another <code>IndexSearcher</code>.
 Example usage of the <code>JoinUtil.createJoinQuery()</code>
  :
 </p>
 <pre class="prettyprint">
 String fromField = "from"; // Name of the from field
 boolean multipleValuesPerDocument = false; // Set only yo true in the case when your fromField has multiple values per document in your index
 String toField = "to"; // Name of the to field
 ScoreMode scoreMode = ScoreMode.Max // Defines how the scores are translated into the other side of the join.
 Query fromQuery = new TermQuery(new Term("content", searchTerm)); // Query executed to collect from values to join to the to values
 Query joinQuery = JoinUtil.createJoinQuery(fromField, multipleValuesPerDocument, toField, fromQuery, fromSearcher, scoreMode);
 TopDocs topDocs = toSearcher.search(joinQuery, 10); // Note: toSearcher can be the same as the fromSearcher
 // Render topDocs...
