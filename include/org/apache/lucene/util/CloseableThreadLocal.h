/*!
 @brief Java's builtin ThreadLocal has a serious flaw:
 it can take an arbitrarily long amount of time to
 dereference the things you had stored in it, even once the
 ThreadLocal instance itself is no longer referenced.
 This is because there is single, master map stored for
 each thread, which all ThreadLocals share, and that
 master map only periodically purges "stale" entries.
 While not technically a memory leak, because eventually
 the memory will be reclaimed, it can take a long time
 and you can easily hit OutOfMemoryError because from the
 GC's standpoint the stale entries are not reclaimable.
 This class works around that, by only enrolling
 WeakReference values into the ThreadLocal, and
 separately holding a hard reference to each stored
 value.  When you call <code>close</code>, these hard
 references are cleared and then GC is freely able to
 reclaim space by objects stored in it.
 We can not rely on <code>ThreadLocal.remove()</code> as it
 only removes the value for the caller thread, whereas
 <code>close</code> takes care of all
 threads.  You should not call <code>close</code> until all
 threads are done using the instance.
