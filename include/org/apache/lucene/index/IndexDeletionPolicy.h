/*!
 @brief <p>Expert: policy for deletion of stale <code>index commits</code>.
 <p>Implement this interface, and pass it to one
 of the <code>IndexWriter</code> or <code>IndexReader</code>
 constructors, to customize when older
 <code>point-in-time commits</code>
 are deleted from the index directory.  The default deletion policy
 is <code>KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy</code>, which always
 removes old commits as soon as a new commit is done (this
 matches the behavior before 2.2).</p>
 <p>One expected use case for this (and the reason why it
 was first created) is to work around problems with an
 index directory accessed via filesystems like NFS because
 NFS does not provide the "delete on last close" semantics
 that Lucene's "point in time" search normally relies on.
 By implementing a custom deletion policy, such as "a
 commit is only removed once it has been stale for more
 than X minutes", you can give your readers time to
 refresh to the new commit before <code>IndexWriter</code>
 removes the old commits.  Note that doing so will
 increase the storage requirements of the index.  See <a
 target="top"
 href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-710">LUCENE-710</a>
 for details.</p>
 <p>Implementers of sub-classes should make sure that <code>clone()</code>
 returns an independent instance able to work with any other <code>IndexWriter</code>
 or <code>Directory</code> instance.</p>

 @brief <p>This is called each time the writer completed a commit.
 This gives the policy a chance to remove old commit points
 with each commit.</p>
 <p>The policy may now choose to delete old commit points

 of <code>IndexCommit</code>.</p>
 <p>This method is only called when <code>IndexWriter.commit</code>
  or <code>IndexWriter.close</code> is
 called, or possibly not at all if the <code>IndexWriter.rollback</code>
  is called.
 <p><u>Note:</u> the last CommitPoint is the most recent one,

 unless you know for sure what you are doing, and unless 
 you can afford to lose the index content while doing that.
