/*!
 @brief IndexReader is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing a
 point-in-time view of an index.
 Any changes made to the index
 via <code>IndexWriter</code> will not be visible until a new
 <code>IndexReader</code> is opened.  It's best to use <code>DirectoryReader.open(IndexWriter,boolean)</code>
  to obtain an
 <code>IndexReader</code>, if your <code>IndexWriter</code> is
 in-process.  When you need to re-open to see changes to the
 index, it's best to use <code>DirectoryReader.openIfChanged(DirectoryReader)</code>
 since the new reader will share resources with the previous
 one when possible.  Search of an index is done entirely
 through this abstract interface, so that any subclass which
 implements it is searchable.
 <p>There are two different types of IndexReaders:
 <ul>
 <li><code>LeafReader</code>: These indexes do not consist of several sub-readers,
 they are atomic. They support retrieval of stored fields, doc values, terms,
 and postings.
 <li><code>CompositeReader</code>: Instances (like <code>DirectoryReader</code>)
 of this reader can only
 be used to get stored fields from the underlying LeafReaders,
 but it is not possible to directly retrieve postings. To do that, get
 the sub-readers via <code>CompositeReader.getSequentialSubReaders</code>.
 Alternatively, you can mimic an <code>LeafReader</code> (with a serious slowdown),
 by wrapping composite readers with <code>SlowCompositeReaderWrapper</code>.
 </ul>
 <p>IndexReader instances for indexes on disk are usually constructed
 with a call to one of the static <code>DirectoryReader.open()</code> methods,
 e.g. <code>DirectoryReader.open(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory)</code>. <code>DirectoryReader</code> implements
 the <code>CompositeReader</code> interface, it is not possible to directly get postings.
 <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
 as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.
 <p>
 <a name="thread-safety"></a><p><b>NOTE</b>: <code>IndexReader</code>
  instances are completely thread
 safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its methods,
 concurrently.  If your application requires external
 synchronization, you should <b>not</b> synchronize on the
 <code>IndexReader</code> instance; use your own
 (non-Lucene) objects instead.
