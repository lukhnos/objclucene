 @brief <p>Expert: represents a single commit into an index as seen by the

 <p> Changes to the content of an index are made visible
 only after the writer who made that change commits by
 writing a new segments file
 (<code>segments_N</code>). This point in time, when the
 action of writing of a new segments file to the directory
 is completed, is an index commit.</p>
 <p>Each index commit point has a unique segments file
 associated with it. The segments file associated with a
 later index commit point would have a larger N.</p>
