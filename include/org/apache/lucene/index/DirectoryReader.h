/*!
 @brief DirectoryReader is an implementation of <code>CompositeReader</code>
 that can read indexes in a <code>Directory</code>.
 <p>DirectoryReader instances are usually constructed with a call to
 one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. <code>open(Directory)</code>
 .
 <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
 as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.
 <p>
 <a name="thread-safety"></a><p><b>NOTE</b>: <code>IndexReader</code>
  instances are completely thread
 safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its methods,
 concurrently.  If your application requires external
 synchronization, you should <b>not</b> synchronize on the
 <code>IndexReader</code> instance; use your own
 (non-Lucene) objects instead.

 @brief Expert: If there changes (committed or not) in the
 <code>IndexWriter</code> versus what the provided reader is
 searching, then open and return a new
 IndexReader searching both committed and uncommitted
 changes from the writer; else, return null (though, the
 current implementation never returns null).
 <p>This provides "near real-time" searching, in that
 changes made during an <code>IndexWriter</code> session can be
 quickly made available for searching without closing
 the writer nor calling <code>IndexWriter.commit</code>.
 <p>It's <i>near</i> real-time because there is no hard
 guarantee on how quickly you can get a new reader after
 making changes with IndexWriter.  You'll have to
 experiment in your situation to determine if it's
 fast enough.  As this is a new and experimental
 feature, please report back on your findings so we can
 learn, improve and iterate.</p>
 <p>The very first time this method is called, this
 writer instance will make every effort to pool the
 readers that it opens for doing merges, applying
 deletes, etc.  This means additional resources (RAM,
 file descriptors, CPU time) will be consumed.</p>
 <p>For lower latency on reopening a reader, you should
 call <code>IndexWriterConfig.setMergedSegmentWarmer</code> to
 pre-warm a newly merged segment before it's committed
 to the index.  This is important for minimizing
 index-to-search delay after a large merge.  </p>
 <p>If an addIndexes* call is running in another thread,
 then this reader will only search those segments from
 the foreign index that have been successfully copied
 over, so far.</p>
 <p><b>NOTE</b>: Once the writer is closed, any
 outstanding readers may continue to be used.  However,
 if you attempt to reopen any of those readers, you'll
 hit an <code>org.apache.lucene.store.AlreadyClosedException</code>.</p>
