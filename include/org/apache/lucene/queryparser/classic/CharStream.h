/*!
 @brief This interface describes a character stream that maintains line and
 column number positions of the characters.
 It also has the capability
 to backup the stream to some extent.  An implementation of this
 interface is used in the TokenManager implementation generated by
 JavaCCParser.
 All the methods except backup can be implemented in any fashion. backup
 needs to be implemented correctly for the correct operation of the lexer.
 Rest of the methods are all used to get information like line number,
 column number and the String that constitutes a token and are not used
 by the lexer. Hence their implementation won't affect the generated lexer's
 operation.
