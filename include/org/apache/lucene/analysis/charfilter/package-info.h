 @brief Normalization of text before the tokenizer.
 <p>
 CharFilters are chainable filters that normalize text before tokenization 
 and provide mappings between normalized text offsets and the corresponding 
 offset in the original text.
 </p>
 <H2>CharFilter offset mappings</H2>
 <p>
 CharFilters modify an input stream via a series of substring
 replacements (including deletions and insertions) to produce an output
 stream. There are three possible replacement cases: the replacement
 string has the same length as the original substring; the replacement
 is shorter; and the replacement is longer. In the latter two cases
 (when the replacement has a different length than the original),
 one or more offset correction mappings are required.
 </p>
 <p>
 When the replacement is shorter than the original (e.g. when the
 replacement is the empty string), a single offset correction mapping
 should be added at the replacement's end offset in the output stream.
 The <code>cumulativeDiff</code> parameter to the
 <code>addOffCorrectMapping()</code> method will be the sum of all
 previous replacement offset adjustments, with the addition of the
 difference between the lengths of the original substring and the
 replacement string (a positive value).
 </p>
 <p>
 When the replacement is longer than the original (e.g. when the
 original is the empty string), you should add as many offset
 correction mappings as the difference between the lengths of the
 replacement string and the original substring, starting at the
 end offset the original substring would have had in the output stream.
 The <code>cumulativeDiff</code> parameter to the
 <code>addOffCorrectMapping()</code> method will be the sum of all
 previous replacement offset adjustments, with the addition of the
 difference between the lengths of the original substring and the
 replacement string so far (a negative value).
 </p>
