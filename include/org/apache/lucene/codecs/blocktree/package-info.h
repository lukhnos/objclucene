 @brief BlockTree terms dictionary.
 <p>
 This terms dictionary organizes all terms into blocks according to
 shared prefix, such that each block has enough terms, and then stores
 the prefix trie in memory as an FST as the index structure.  It allows
 you to plug in your own <code>org.apache.lucene.codecs.PostingsWriterBase</code>
  to implement the
 postings.
 </p>
 <p>See <code>org.apache.lucene.codecs.blocktree.BlockTreeTermsWriter</code>
 for the file format.
