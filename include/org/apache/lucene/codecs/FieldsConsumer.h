 @brief Write all fields, terms and postings.
 This the "pull"
 API, allowing you to iterate more than once over the
 postings, somewhat analogous to using a DOM API to
 traverse an XML tree.
 <p><b>Notes</b>:
 <ul>
 <li> You must compute index statistics,
 including each Term's docFreq and totalTermFreq,
 as well as the summary sumTotalTermFreq,
 sumTotalDocFreq and docCount.
 <li> You must skip terms that have no docs and
 fields that have no terms, even though the provided
 Fields API will expose them; this typically
 requires lazily writing the field or term until
 you've actually seen the first term or
 document.
 <li> The provided Fields instance is limited: you
 cannot call any methods that return
 statistics/counts; you cannot pass a non-null
 live docs when pulling docs/positions enums.
 </ul>
